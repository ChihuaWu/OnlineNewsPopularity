## Introduction
The work is a school project that helps us to be more familiar with algorithms and analytical skills. The project cannot be completed without the teamwork, thank you guys. We used JMP software to do all the work. In this repository, it will mainly focus on the methods instead of tool. And I'll demonstrate other techniques to extrat more information from the data. More details can be found in the pdf file. Please don't hesitate to leave your comments and ideas. 


## Data Introduction
The dataset is called “Online News Popularity Data Set” and it can be accessed from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu). Each row represents a news article and was collected from January 7, 2013 to January 7, 2015. There are 39,797 rows and 61 columns as shown in the Appendix Table 1. The original dataset contained 37 attributes of articles, and several natural language processing features were extracted by previous researchers (Fernandes, Vinagre & Cortez, 2015). In this study, 17 selected predictors are used to build models.


## The previous work
The previous work is available in this [website](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283510525_A_Proactive_Intelligent_Decision_Support_System_for_Predicting_the_Popularity_of_Online_News). The best result was provided by a Random Forest with a discrimination power of 73%. Our goal is trying to beat them with higher accuracy.


## Data Pre-processing
There're several things should be eliminated to achieve a refined model and interpretation.
-	Missing value
-	Outliers
- Cannot interpret due to a lack of documentation


## Methodolgy
The methodology of this study is followed by SEMMA.(Shmueli, Bruce, Stephens & Patel, 2017, p. 18)

## Conlcusion
In conclusion, to improve social media virality, we suggest Mashable focus most on publishing the right types of articles, with the right keywords, at the right time. Specifically, efforts like publishing articles on the weekend would cost Mashable little to nothing and would significantly increase social media visibility, while efforts like including many images in articles cost Mashable time and money and achieve very little. With our insights and recommendations, we believe that the average popularity of Mashable articles on social media would increase considerably.
