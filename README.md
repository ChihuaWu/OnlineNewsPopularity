## Introduction
The original work is a school project that helps us to be more familiar with algorithms and analytical skills. The project cannot be completed without the teamwork. Thank you all my teammates, especially Josh Wilder. The original work is conducted by JMP software. In this repository, I will try to duplicated the works by a powerful tool, Python. And I'll demonstrate other techniques to extrat more information from the data. Please don't hesitate to point out any mistakes or grammer. I'm happy to correct them and have a dicussion.


## Data Introduction
The dataset is called “Online News Popularity Data Set” and it can be accessed from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu). Each row represents a news article and was collected from January 7, 2013 to January 7, 2015. There are 39,797 rows and 61 columns as shown in the Appendix Table 1. The original dataset contained 37 attributes of articles, and several natural language processing features were extracted by previous researchers (Fernandes, Vinagre & Cortez, 2015). In this study, 17 selected predictors are used to build models.


## The previous work
The previous work is available in this [website](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283510525_A_Proactive_Intelligent_Decision_Support_System_for_Predicting_the_Popularity_of_Online_News). The best result was provided by a Random Forest with a discrimination power of 73%. Our goal is trying to beat them with higher accuracy.
